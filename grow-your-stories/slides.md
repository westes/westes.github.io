## With People Who Care
---

layout: false

## Why?

- "A writer writes."
- We tell good stories,
- Maybe to share them;
- Maybe just for ourselves.

---

## What?

- write
- learn
- share and respond
---
### We write ...

- maybe a whole story
- maybe try something out

---

### We learn ...

- because our stories which are good
- could grow more
- and be more what we meant them to be

Games, exercises, discussion / q&a

---

### We share and respond ...

- as a community
- to help you tell your story
- you ask for what your story needs

We call it /Collaborative Feedback/.

---

### It's as easy as ...

1. SEEDLING:  new writers and new stories need wild encouragement
2. SAPLING: what works? Where is their room for growth?
3. Does the story do what you want it to do in the ways you want that done?
