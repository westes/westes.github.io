## Welcome

::: incremental
You are here
: SPACE Creative Writing Workshop
First Intro (it's really a mic check)
: What is your name?
: Where are you broadcasting from?
: nothing else

A bit more intro (let's get to know each other)
: Why did you sign up for this module?
: What are you working on this month?
:::

## Who?

- you (you just introduced yourselves)
- your preceptor's [official and totally reassuringly serious and completely factual bio](https://signumuniversity.org/people/will-estes/)

## What?

We _are_ writers.

- "A writer writes."

Nothing more; nothing less.

## How?

- write
- learn
- share and respond
- have fun

## We write ...

- maybe a whole story
- maybe try something out

## We learn ...

- because our stories which are good
- could grow more
- and be more what we meant them to be

## We share and respond ...

- as a community
- to help you tell your story
- you ask for what your story needs

We call it *Collaborative Feedback*.

## It's as easy as ...

::: incremental
1 - Seedling
: new writers and new stories need wild encouragement

2 - SAPLING
: what works? Where is their room for growth?

Tree
: Does the story do what you want it to do in the ways you want that done?
:::

## Have Fun

- Games
-exercises
-discussion / q&a

## On Having A Plan

> An excellent plan.
> 
> And the best thing about it was that having made it the horse could now completely and utterly ignore it.
> 
> -- Douglas Adams _Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency_

That is to say: This is your class. The plan is for when nothing else is happening.

## Responses

We have two pieces

- Sparrow sent us the beginning of a story
- Jamie sent us her first thing ever in SPACE CW!

## But Wait!

What are all these feedback methods you keep talking about?

::: incremental
- There are a lot of feedback frameworks.
- but who wants a big huge long list of things?
- we will have that list for reference purposes though
- but in class, we'll go over them as needed
- so as not to overwhelm/flood/drown

## Responding to Sparrow's Work

First, popcorn:
- What is one thing you like about this story?

Premis, Promise, Payoff

Based on what you have read ...

Premise
: What do you, as reader, understand to be the world and situation you have entered?
Promise
: What do you, as reader, expect to see along the way as the story unfolds?
Payoff
: Where is the story going to end up?

## Responding to Jamie's Work

Jamie! Thank you!

We have a custom: If it's your first time putting a piece in front of SPACE Creative Writing Workshop, we do one thing:

Everyone simply respond with: Why do you want this story to thrive?

## Next Time

- Think about why you write?
    - publication?
    - in search of healing?
    - stories that won't leave you alone?
    - to tell stories?
    - ... ?
- Do you have something to send by Saturday bed time?
    I'll probably post things Sunday morning early, but it's my first time wrangling the pre-Monday part of the module so ...
